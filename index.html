        <checklist></checklist>

        This is the structure of the HTML tag. 

        The <checklist></checklist> will be replaced with the real checklist on the DOM.

        * If the <checklist> element has no attributes (as above), it will create an empty checklist and the title of the checklist will be "Checklist" as a default.

        The <checklist> element can get 2 attributes:     

        data-items: Add these items as the pre-added items. User can change or delete existing ones, or add new items.
        data-title: Name the checklist what the data-title offers. The title is "SEO Checklist" in this example.


        ## Example ##

        <checklist data-items='["Fast site speed","SEO friendly URLs", "Good internal links", "Structured data", "Social media strateg"]'
        data-title="SEO Checklist">
        </checklist>
    -->

    <checklist data-items='["Fast site speed","SEO friendly URLs", "Good internal links", "Structured data", "Social media strategy"]' data-title="SEO Checklist">

            <h1>Interactive Presentation 101: How to Create An Interactive Deck</h1>
            <h3>When you organize your presentation, you would like it to be attractive. Whether you display them in real-time or embed them on your website, you wish to entertain your audience. The simplest way is to form an interactive presentation. This
                may keep the audience's attention and even engage them.</h3>

            <p>
                How you are going to do this is going to depend on the scale of your audience; If you're presenting in a group or seminar, you'll be able to easily move around the room and let everyone discuss with you.
            </p>

            <p>
                If you're speaking before a crowd or in an exceedingly large meeting with a bigger audience, it makes more sense to easily introduce your audience to a neighbor or two before entering the discussion.
            </p>

            <p>
                You'll ask the audience to answer questions aloud or work along with your neighbors to arrange some questions about your topic or a listing of things they need to find out or create a fun icebreaker game. Search for what kinds of icebreaker questions
                may make sense for the context of your presentation.
